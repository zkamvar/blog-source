I promise that from now on, I will update this blog at least once a week with
thoughts or insights I have about R package development, research software
engineering, and updates to R packages. In the meantime, have a picture of my

[^1]: I'm not going to go into the details of getting a visa to the UK and subsequently looking for housing, but let's just say that I was reading [Kafka's **The Trial**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18745889-the-trial) and I have never before related so hard to a book in my life.
