Last Tuesday, I released [poppr version 2.8.3], which [fixed a corner case in 
`read.genalex()`](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/pull/202) and enhanced
minimum spanning network rendering by [drawing single-population nodes as 
circles instead of pies](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/201) (with
contribution by Frédéric Chevalier). This version also comes with fixes for
mistakes that past Zhian made (such as [using the `<<-`
operator](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/pull/205/commits/91e10be560594)
and searching for user objects in the global environment[^1]). The last issue
had me [sitting at my laptop off and on over the weekend trying to get things to
work](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/compare/503bdb4bb...d92642ab82).

This last week, I realized that I've been maintaining poppr on a voluntary
basis since April 2018.[^2] This spans all of the poppr releases from version
2.8.0 onwards. Some, releases---like [poppr version 2.8.2]---took almost no
effort to release[^3], but others, like [poppr version 2.8.0] and [poppr version
2.8.3] took several days of problem solving to actually get right.

TODO: 
1. open source is never developed for free
2. it's important to pay people for their work
2.1 some people have a digital tip jar on their pages (for coffee!)
3. charityware exists because developers are already paid through different means (vim)
4. I am donating and I want you to, too.

[^1]: not together, though
[^2]: Poppr was the subject of [my Ph. D. dissertation](https://zkamvar.github.io/dissertation), and I had a small line of funding during my first postdoc in the Everhart lab to maintain it. 
[^3]: This is in part due to CRAN's volunteer work in automating the pipeline from submission to acceptance of package updates.
