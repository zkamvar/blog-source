<p>Occasionally, I hear people complain about the strict policies of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr">CRAN</a>, but I for one quite apprecieate them, especially when dealing with hidden errors in compiled code.</p>
<p>Not twenty-four hours after I had submitted <a href="https://zkamvar.github.io/blog/poppr-2-6-0-better-network-plotting/">poppr version 2.6.0</a> to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr">CRAN</a> did I receive an email from none other than Brian D. Ripley. If you are unfamiliar with the name, then know that it tends to <a href="http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2013/12/10/I-violated-CRAN-Repository-Policies/">strike fear</a> in the hearts of even the <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/276022791839571968">most steeled</a>:</p>

<p>This was not the first time I got an email from Ripley (and probably won’t be the last). More often than not, the emails I get from him alert me to little things that have gone wrong in memory allocation for code that I’ve written in C. The email I got from him on January 9th was informing me that there was a new note from the <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/README.txt">clang address sanitizer</a> saying that there was a <a href="https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/issues/169">potential memory leak in <code>bitwise_distance.c</code></a>:</p>

<p>Please correct ASAP and before Jan 24 to safely retain the package on CRAN.</p>

<div id="fixing-the-error" class="section level1">
<h1>Fixing the error</h1>
<p>I had initially attempted to try to reproduce the error using a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zkamvar/poppr-devel-docker/~/dockerfile/">docker container built with the address sanitizer</a>, but quickly became frustrated with it due to errors unrelated to poppr. My next plan of action was to inspect the code using a debugger. I found <a href="http://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2015/04/13/debugging-with-lldb/">Kevin Ushey’s blog post on debugging with LLDB</a> and began to go to work.</p>
<p>The error occurred <a href="https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/blob/453f08f56574b778775988e7fce2650d4a37ef5f/src/bitwise_distance.c#L674">at the end of a “while” loop</a> that was written four years ago. Here’s what the code looks like without the comments:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>while(next_missing_index_i &lt; nap1_length &amp;&amp; next_missing_i &lt; (k+1)*8 &amp;&amp; next_missing_i &gt;= (k*8) )
{
  mask = 1 &lt;&lt; (next_missing_i%8); 
  if(missing_match)
  {
    tmp_sim_set |= mask; // Force the missing bit to match
  }
  else
  {
    tmp_sim_set &amp;= ~mask; // Force the missing bit to not match
  }
  // Find the index of the next missing value in sample i.
  next_missing_index_i++; 
  next_missing_i = (int)INTEGER(R_nap1)[next_missing_index_i] - 1; // &lt;--- BUG!
}       </code></pre>
<p>I won’t go into detail what this code does, but the reason why it triggered a warning from the address sanitizer is because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error">fencepost error</a>. The loop monitors <code>next_missing_index_i</code> and repeats the operation until it is equal to <code>nap1_length</code>, which happens to be the length of the array it indexes. Because the index is incremented before the array is indexed, the last step of the loop always attempts to access a bit of memory that wasn’t allocated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: to debug, be sure to change your optimization flags to <code>-O0</code> for your compiler. You can do this in your <code>~/.R/Makevars</code> file:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>CFLAGS +=         -O0 -Wall -pipe -pedantic -std=gnu99 -fopenmp
CXXFLAGS +=       -O0 -Wall -pipe -Wno-unused -pedantic
CXX1XFLAGS +=     -O0 -pipe
PKG_CXX1XFLAGS += -O0 -pipe</code></pre>

<p>Using the debugger was surprisingly easy. My process was to tweak the C code and then start R with the debugger, and install poppr:</p>
<pre class="lldb"><code>17:47:09~/Documents/poppr (master)&gt; R -d lldb
*** Further command line arguments (&#39;--no-save --no-restore-data &#39;) disregarded
*** (maybe use &#39;run --no-save --no-restore-data &#39; from *inside* lldb)

&gt; devtools::install()
...
&gt; library(&quot;poppr&quot;)
...
&gt;</code></pre>
<p>After that, I could load my test data and, before I ran <code>bitwise.dist()</code>, I hit <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd>, which took me back into lldb:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>&gt; Process 10723 stopped

<p>From there, to get it to breakpoint on the specific line, I typed:</p>

<p>We can see that <code>next_missing_i</code> is set to 4, <code>next_missing_index_i</code> is currently set to 1 and the <code>nap1_length</code> is set to 2. If we type “n”, it will execute the current line. We can then see the new value of <code>next_missing_i</code></p>
<pre class="c"><code>(lldb) print next_missing_i
(int) $1 = 17</code></pre>
<p>Instead of going line by line, you can type “c” to go to the next breakpoint and execute the code there. This happens to be the point of the error. You can see that if we execute line 674 and then print <code>next_missing_i</code>:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>(lldb) print next_missing_i
(int) $2 = 536870927</code></pre>
<p>The data I fed into this function only has 24 possible positions, so this huge number is the memory leak.</p>

<div id="solution" class="section level1">
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>The solution I eventually came up with was to wrap it in another check:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>  // Find the index of the next missing value in sample i.
  next_missing_index_i++; 
  if (next_missing_index_i &lt; nap1_length){
    next_missing_i = (int)INTEGER(R_nap1)[next_missing_index_i] - 1;
  }</code></pre>
<p>Is it elegant? No. Did it get the job done? Yes. I had originally moved the assignment step to the top of the loop, but had tests fail that way and I couldn’t figure out what was going on with them.</p>
</div>
<div id="lesson-learned" class="section level1">
<h1>Lesson learned</h1>
<p>This error has been in the code for four years. It wasn’t particularly malicious since it wasn’t overwriting this space of memory, but it’s the kind of error that could only be detected by these address sanitizers routinely used by the CRAN team. In fact, the Valgrind sanitizer had pointed out this very error, but, I had (wrongly) thought that this was due to the fact that <a href="https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/blob/379c42ba52afb9e2ce2bbf9141bf540cb16d0a37/cran-comments.md#valgrind">it was in the middle of a parallel processing statement since the memory was only “possibly” lost</a>. Sometimes these errors are obvious and other times it takes you over a year and a half to find these bugs and squish them).</p>
