<img src="/images/meep.jpg" width=225 align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 0px 0px"> I am a computational biologist currently working a post-doctoral researcher in [Thibaut Jombart's][tj] group at Imperial College in London, UK where I focus on developing tools and resources for outbreak response analytics. 

I grew up in Cupertino, CA, but got my undergraduate degree in Biology at [Truman State University][tsu] in Kirksville, MO where I had a research opportunity to work on understanding the [regulation of shoot apical meristem development in maize][1]. After graduation, I spent three years teaching and making music in South Korea before going back to the US to pursue my graduate education.

My Ph. D. is from the [Department of Botany and Plant Pathology][bpp] at [Oregon State University][osu] where I worked in the lab of [Dr. Nik Gr√ºnwald][nik]. [My dissertation][diss] focuses on my development of computational tools for analyzing clonal populations in the R package [*poppr*][poppr].

From 2017-01--2018-04, I was a postdoc in the lab of [Dr. Sydney E. Everhart][see] at the [Department of Plant Pathology at University of Nebraska-Lincoln][unl]. My research focus sought to understand the populations structure and dynamics of the plant pathogen *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*. 
 

Radio
-----

In January of 2012, [Joey Hulbert][joey] and I began interviewing graduate
students at OSU about the inspiration for their research. This developed into
the [award-winning][awd] radio program [Inspiration Dissemination][id] on OSU's
student-run radio station, [KBVR][kbvr] (88.7 FM).

Our mission is to engage and inspire undergraduates to pursue graduate research
by sharing the personal stories of graduate students at OSU each week. 

Interests

Beyond Science and Communication, these are a few of my favorite things
(incomplete list in no particular order):

 - listening to and playing music (I enjoy [several forms][lastfm])
 - baking
 - cats
 - science fiction and literature you can [stalk me on goodreads if you like](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6179714-zinc-potassium)
