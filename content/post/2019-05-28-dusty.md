Hoo-boy! It has been a long time since [last wrote in this 
blog](../poppr-2-7/index.html) and... well... a lot has happened[^1] since then.

I promise that from now on, I will update this blog at least once a week with
thoughts or insights I have about R package development, research software
engineering, and updates to R packages. In the meantime, have a picture of my
precious baby boy, whom I had to leave in California:

[^1]: I'm not going to go into the details of getting a visa to the UK and
subsequently looking for housing, but let's just say that I was reading
[Kafka's **The Trial**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18745889-the-trial)
and I have never before related so hard to a book in my life.
