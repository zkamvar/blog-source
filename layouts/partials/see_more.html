                <p class="lead">
                  Consulting Datactive at <a href="http://www.thinkr.fr">ThinkR</a>
                  since February 2017.
                  <br/>
                  I have been involved in the
                  <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R community</a>
                  for several years. I'm interested in anything that
                  is even remotely connected to R.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                  I am specifically interested in performance and mixing R with
                  other languages, which led to the development of
                  <a href="http://www.rcpp.org">Rcpp</a> for seamless
                  R and C++ integration. I also contributed to the design and implementation of 
                  C++ internals for <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org">dplyr</a>. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                  I am never far from my <a href="https://twitter.com/romain_francois">twitter</a>
                  or <a href="https://github.com/romainfrancois">github</a> accounts. I am 
                  passionate about R, discovering or making new R things, and helping you
                  make the most of R.
